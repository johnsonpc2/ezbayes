ezbayes is a wrapper package that bundles several of the basic steps when conducting Bayesian analysis in R, such as model fitting, parameter estimation, and visualizations. The package makes use of functions from the BRMS package, and is largely based on examples and code from the second edition of Doing Bayesian Data Analysis by John Kruschke.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ezbayes from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("johnsonpc2/ezbayes")
```
